# Calyx RPA Python Course
## Final Project

<br> <br>
#### There are two exercises, about automation using python
1. Managing a desktop application
2. Buying on a website

<br> <br>
#### Things I would like to mention:
- About exercise 1:
    - I didn't write the upload date.

- Logs:
    - The log files are created outside the right folder, but I don't see why.
    - The logs are written, but I would like to do a better logging management,

- Modules:
    - I had problems when packaging modules in folders, so I had to leave the files in a main folder.
