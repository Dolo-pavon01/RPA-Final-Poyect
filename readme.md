# Calyx RPA Python Course
## Final Project

<br> <br>
#### There are two exercises, about automation using python
1. Managing a desktop application
2. Buying on a website

<br> <br>
#### Things I would like to mention:
- About exercise 1:
    - I didn't write the upload date.

- About exercise 2:
    - I would like to add columns to the excel file
        - With the price of each purchase.
        - With total saved money (no spent money of each purchase).
        - With Total spent money + shipping cost.
    - It can be improved the code that manages products that couln't been bought because of the maximum stop of each order.
    - I didn't check if the correct amount of a product was added to the cart.

#### Errors:
Logs:
    The log files are created outside the right folder, but I don't see why.

In exercise 2:
    I had an interpretation error about what happens when I couldn't buy an itep (because of the maximum money limit by purchase). I didn't understand that when I can't buy all items of a product, then in the next purchase I can buy the items that couln't been bought with the maximum money limit ($250.80) again.
